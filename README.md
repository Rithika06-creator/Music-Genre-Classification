# Music-Genre-Classification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 10 different music genres from audio files. It extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from 3-second audio segments and uses these "images" to train a deep learning model with TensorFlow/Keras.
